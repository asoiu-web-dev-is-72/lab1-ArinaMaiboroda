		<p>The right routine starts with knowing what kind of skin you have. Then you'll know how to take care of it.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Dry skin is flaky, scaly, or rough.</li>
			<li>Oily skin is shiny, greasy, and may have big pores.</li>
			<li>Combination skin is dry in some spots (cheeks) and oily in others (forehead, nose, and chin).</li>
			<li>Sensitive skin may sting, burn, or itch after you use some makeup or other products.</li>
			<li>Normal skin is balanced, clear, and not sensitive.</li>
		</ul>

		<em><h2><span style="color: orange;font-weight: ">Step 2: Moisturize</span></h2></em>

		<p>You may think you're too young to need moisturizer -- or your skin is too oily -- but all skin types need one every day. Apply it while your skin is still damp from washing or rinsing to help seal in moisture. If you have acne or your skin is oily, find a moisturizer that's lightweight and oil-free, so it won't block your pores.</p>

		<em><h2><span style="color: orange;font-weight: ">Step 3: Don't Wear Makeup to Bed</span></h2></em>

		<p>When you're tired, it can be tempting to go to bed without washing your face. But leaving makeup on your skin can clog your pores and cause acne. So wash it off with a gentle cleanser or makeup remover. Use a soft wash cloth or cotton pads. If you use acne medicine, now's a good time to put it on -- when your face is clean and you won't be putting on makeup.</p>

		<em><h2><span style="color: orange;font-weight: ">Step 4: Food and Sleep for Healthy Skin</span></h2></em>

		<p>Keep your skin healthy by eating smart. Fill your plate with veggies, fruits, and whole grains. Choose lean proteins like chicken, fish, lean meat, beans, and eggs. Avoid foods that are high in cholesterol, trans fats, saturated fats, salt, and sugar. Get plenty of sleep to avoid dark circles, fine lines, dull skin, and other side effects of bad rest. Relax! Even stress can make you break out. And stay hydrated.</p>
